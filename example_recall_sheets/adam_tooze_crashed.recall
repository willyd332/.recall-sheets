Crashed is a book about the 2008 financial crisis, what happened and how we were rescued from something even worse – but at a price which continues to undermine democracy across Europe and the United States. Gnawing away at our institutions are the many billions of dollars which were conjured up to prevent complete collapse. Over and over again, the end of the crisis has been announced, but it continues to hound us – whether in Greece or Ukraine, whether through Brexit or Trump.
Tooze sets out to answer the question: “What is the relationship of the economic crisis of 2008 to the geopolitical disaster of 2003 and to America's political crisis following the election of November 2016 (and Brexit)? What arc of historical transition do those three points stake out? What does that arc mean for Europe, for Asia?” The book is both technical and historical, highlighting historical arcs and the economic details of modern finance.
At the highest level, the book is structured as follows:
Situates 2008 as the first crisis of a genuinely globalized financial system, centred on the dollar but enmeshing banks, markets and states across North America, Europe and the emerging world.
Part I – Gathering Storm: traces build-up of risk—U.S. subprime housing, trans-Atlantic shadow banking, exchange-rate imbalances, euro-area fragilities—arguing that systemic vulnerability arose from tight monetary integration without matching political coordination.
Part II – The Global Crisis: recounts the 2008–09 freeze, showing how only massive dollar liquidity from the Federal Reserve and coordinated bail-outs prevented collapse, thereby confirming the United States’ unique power inside an ostensibly multipolar order.
Part III – Eurozone: presents the 2010–12 sovereign-debt saga as a second, self-inflicted chapter—rooted in flawed monetary union design, German creditor politics and belated “whatever-it-takes” intervention—demonstrating that Europe’s crisis was not separate but a downstream effect of the dollar shock.
Part IV – Aftershocks: follows the wave of consequences from 2013 onward—QE “taper tantrum,” Ukraine conflict, populist nationalism, Brexit, Trump—arguing that financial turmoil spilled into geopolitics, undermining liberal internationalism and deepening inequality.
Overall arc claims the decade’s successive crises recast global capitalism: reaffirmed U.S. monetary hegemony, exposed euro-zone weakness, shifted power toward Asia, and fed political backlash, leaving a fractured landscape still defined by unresolved debt, liquidity and legitimacy questions.

There are two types of informational-types that you should be adding.
One, is technical—usually financial or economic definitions—probably abstracted from the context. For example, the book describes the role ABCP (asset backed commercial paper) distributed through SIVs (structured investment vehicles) played in the crash. Since these are distinct, definable, financial ideas, you should create information blocks explaining them independently of the historical context.
Two, is historical. The book is, fundamentally, a history book. Studying it means understanding what it is telling use about history. But rather than making useless information blocks like "What year did xyz occur?" I want you to create information blocks that try to get at the underlying causal chain of events and their logic. For example, when Tooze talks about the ABCP and SIVs, he explains how they are related to the bigger picture: Freddie and Fannie, investment banks rushing to get in on the mortgage action, how Emerging World Markets boom (once China et al. bought up all the US treasuries) created demand for AAA mortgages, and how THAT is why ABCPs and SIVs became necessary etc. Similarly, information block focusing on the later impacts and implications of events are good. In short, when making blocks of historical information, make sure to consider the bigger picture and the historicizing relationships of those events. Indeed, this might result in large blocks of information, and that is fine. History is a verbose field.

Frankly, most of your information blocks for both technical and historical blocks should be a paragraph or more; if not multiple paragraphs. 
=======
The block of information you have been given may be one of two types: one, a financial/economic/political concept and its description/definition/etc., or two, a brief historical summary of some event or historical process.
In the first instance, simply ask the student to recall the what, why, and how of the financial/economic/political concept described. Additionally, ask them a discussion question about the topic which might challenge their deeper understanding of it. In your answer, give the answer to the what, why, and how, and an example or two.
In the second instance, if the block is historical, I want you to be a bit more creative. Don't just ask a "fill in the blank" or a "what happened when" sort of question. Rather, challenge the student to connect the dots and think critically about why things happen an how they connected. Depending on the specifics of the information block you might ask the user a "what would you do in this situation?" type question, putting them in the position of some historical figure. You might ask them about how two seemingly unrelated events were connected. You might generate a fake headline and ask them to explain the larger context surrounding the headline. You might give them a chain of events and ask them fill in what's missing. etcetera. Don't limit yourself to the possibilities I've just described. Make the student's study session engaging, challenging, and helpful to exercising their capacity for active recall.
